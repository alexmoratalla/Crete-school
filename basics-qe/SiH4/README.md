# PURPOSE OF THE EXERCISE: 
## For isolated molecules convergency with vacuum and plot orbitals 
-------------------------------------------------------
ex1.SiH4
1) make a convergence test with vacuum
2) make the same test but adding on system namelist
assume_isolated='m-t'

ex2.SiH4
1) how to plot orbitals using xcrysden (or VMD, cube format)
