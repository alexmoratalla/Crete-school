# PURPOSE OF THE EXERCISE:
## Convergence pw.x calculations of a simple bulk system (Silicon bulk)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Exercise consists of several examples, the first two being the
convergence tests for cutoff energy (ecutwfc) and k-points.

Convergence tests are typically performed by making a series of
calculations and to this end shell-scripts are utilized, e.g., see
the shell-script: `ex1.ecutwfc.classic/ecutwfc.sh`

**Description of examples:**

* `ex1.ecutwfc` -- convergence tests for cutoff energy
                            (ecutwfc) via traditional Unix shell
                            script
* `ex2.kpoints/` -- k-points (K_POINTS) convergence tests 

* `ex3.alat/` -- search of lattice parameter of Si bulk
                 (alat = A LATtice parameter)

* `ex4.bands/` -- how to calculate band structure (spaghetti plot)
